# ACR122 HID Emulate
Human Interface Device emulator for ACR122 NFC readers. The niche purpose being to provide similar functionality to that of a standard USB HID Magnetic Stripe Reader (MSR). Defaults to simply returning the chip serial number in a similar format to that of a MSR.

Testing performed only on the ACR122U model, but other USB models should work with some minor modifications to the reader package.
