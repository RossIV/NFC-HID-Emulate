# Structure and functionality based on Plover project features.
# May temporarily include some Plover code while I'm still getting my head around things. Even if I remove the Plover
# code I absolutely credit the authors of Plover with making the OS platform flexibility of this package possible (as
# well as my first introduction to what a well designed python application looks like).
